# BSA-for-unmeasured-confounding
For this project, we propose a fully Bayesian sensitivity analysis built upon the framework on unmeasured confounding by Carnegieet al. (2016), and evaluate then impact of unmeasured confounding on a selection of causal effect estimators. Posterior sampling can be constructed with the imputation step for U based on its posterior distribution suggested by Zhou et al (2020), and the posterior step that sample parameters from their full conditions.
