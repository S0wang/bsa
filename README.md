# BSA-for-unmeasured-confounding
For this project, we propose a fully Bayesian sensitivity analysis built upon the framework on unmeasured confounding by Carnegieet al. (2016), and evaluate then impact of unmeasured confounding on a selection of causal effect estimators. Posterior sampling can be constructed with the imputation step for $U$ based on its posterior distribution suggested by \cite{zhou2020bayesian}, and the \textbf{posterior step} that sample parameters from their full conditions.
